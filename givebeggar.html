<img src="beggar.jpg" title="beggar">
<p>You drop a single copper coin in his wooden bowl, delighted by your donation the beggar opens up to you, turns out he has a wealth of information about this area which he is glad to share with you.
    He tells you about a citadel not far from here, that is were the evil is comming from. An evil mage has taken up residence in the tower and is performing all kinds of horror with his black magic, some of these horrors have escaped the tower and have been terrorizing the local villages.
    He tells you that the tower is dificult to get to as it is enchanted with a spell that shifts it's location each night, he tells you that the bartender has a map of the possible locations it might appear in which he might part with for a price.

</p>He also warns you not to go down the back alley, undesirables who are up to no good hang about there.
<p></p>now that you have talked to the beggar where will you visit next.
