<p>Looking around you see many charts hanging from the walls mapping the stars. "looking for a reading" the astrologer querries, he asks for your birth date then studies an old partchment for a leangthy amount of time.
    "How curious" he exclaims, "it seems you have arived at the precise moment that a major alignment of the planets is developing" he goes on to tell you that unseen forces will be working against you but that you have a certain powerfull sence of destiny on your side, he is unable to tell which way the battle will go, only that you will be caught in the middle of it and are in fact instumental in deciding the final outcome.
</p>
<p>You thank the Astrologer for his reading even if it was a bit on the vaugue side</p>
