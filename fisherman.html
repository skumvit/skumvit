<h1>Fisherman</h1>
<img src="fisherman.jpg" title="fisherman">
<p>You aproach the local fisherman, he's a jolly fellow and seems glad for your company.
    you seem to hit it off with witty conversation and eventualy he invites you out to go fishing with him, I'll pay you 2 copper coins for each fish you catch.
    you agree to join him for a few hours, roll 1 dice to see how many fish you catch and add 2 copper coins for each fish.
    while fishing you talk for a great length about the strange goings on in this province.
    while he is easygoing and good to talk to he really does not know much detail about recent events, just storys about warewolves and vampires and other such monsters, mostly rumours which may or may not have an element of truth to it.
