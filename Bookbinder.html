<p>As you enter the little workshop he looks up from his work, "Yes?" he inquires impatently.
    you ask him if he has seen anything unusual recently.
    
    He tells you of a gaunt looking man who came into his shop a few weeks ago who got a book stiched together, strange thing is it was bound with human skin, and the pages within looked to contain spells of some sort.  That was pretty unusual he admitted with a smile.

<p> Who would you like to visit next.
